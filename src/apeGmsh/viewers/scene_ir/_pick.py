"""``PickBackend`` Protocol + pick IR — the viewer-side *pick* contract.

Defined by
[ADR 0047](../../../../architecture/decisions/0047-pick-backend-and-export.md)
(Phase R-D), the pick-side sibling of the render seam (ADR 0042
:mod:`RenderBackend <apeGmsh.viewers.scene_ir._backend>`).  The backend
owns *all* VTK ray-casting and screen↔world geometry; the domain layer
(``viewers/core/``, the two viewers) interprets the geometric hit into a
substrate-native entity.  The clean line (ADR 0047 INV-3):

* the backend resolves **screen → scene geometry** — a ``vtkCellPicker``
  hit (which prop, which cell, the world point) and the camera
  projection — and nothing else;
* mode routing, ``EntityRegistry`` / ``cell_to_element_id`` resolution,
  box-candidate sourcing, highlight overlays, ``Alt``-pick-through, and
  hover *interpretation* stay in the domain layer.

INV-2 (ADR 0047, mirroring ADR 0042 INV-1): this module imports neither
``vtk`` nor ``pyvista``.  Screen coordinates in, an opaque prop id + cell
id + world point out.  Enforced by ``tests/test_scene_ir_pure.py``.

Why ``prop_id`` and not the VTK actor (the keystone refinement over the
ADR's draft body): both domain registries already key on ``id(actor)`` —
``EntityRegistry._actor_id_to_dim`` (mesh, ``(dim, tag)``) and the
results pick inventory (``id(vtkProp) → (kind, …)``).  Returning that
plain integer lets a :class:`PickHit` cross the VTK-free seam while both
domain consumers map it back with their existing dict lookup — no VTK
object ever crosses (INV-2), and the two viewers keep their distinct
entity vocabularies (INV-3, ADR 0045 ``Substrate``).
