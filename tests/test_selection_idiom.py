"""S3e — the cross-chain *idiom* lock (selection-unification).

Sub-phase S3e of the selection-unification work
(``docs/plans/selection-unification.md`` §5/§6).  S3a–S3d landed the
``SelectionChain`` mixin plus the five concrete chains
(``GeometryChain`` entity-family; ``NodeChain`` / ``ElementChain`` /
``ResultChain`` / ``MeshSelectionChain`` point-family) each with its own
focused smoke test.  This file is the *only* file that looks at all
five chains **together** and locks the cross-cutting idiom:

* exactly those five concrete chains exist (a future 6th that skips the
  ``__init_subclass__`` contract is caught here);
* the public verb *names* and their ``inspect.signature`` are identical
  across all five (arities/keyword-only-ness cannot silently drift);
* ``__init_subclass__`` still rejects a bad FAMILY / a dropped verb / a
  missing hook at *class-definition* time;
* per-family behavioural laws hold (point family: half-open vs
  ``inclusive=`` closed, insertion-order set-algebra, deterministic
  ``nearest_to`` tie-break, loud cross-type/cross-engine; entity family:
  ``inclusive=``→``TypeError``, gmsh-BRep set-algebra laws).

CRITICAL SCOPE NOTE (FP-2 / T15, ratified §3, §5):
This file asserts a shared verb-NAME / signature surface **and**
per-family laws.  It NEVER asserts cross-family *behavioural* equality.
``in_box`` is honestly three irreconcilable semantics — entity-family
``gmsh.getEntitiesInBoundingBox`` (BRep CONTAINMENT, closed,
``Geometry.Tolerance``≈1e-8 expanded, *no* half-open knob) vs
point-family node-coordinate / element-centroid half-open ``[lo, hi)``.
There is deliberately no ``GeometryChain`` vs ``NodeChain`` result
comparison anywhere below; the two families are checked in separate,
family-scoped test bodies.

No ``openseespy`` dependency (curated no-openseespy CI gate): pure
apeGmsh + gmsh + numpy + a tiny synthetic native HDF5 results file.
Fixture *patterns* are mirrored (not imported) from
``tests/test_geometry_chain.py``, ``tests/test_fem_chain.py``,
``tests/test_result_chain.py`` and ``tests/test_mesh_selection_chain.py``.
